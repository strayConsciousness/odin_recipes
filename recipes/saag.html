        <h2> Description </h2>
        
        <p>Sarson ka saag is a type of curry, so it is creamy, saucy and simply addictive. Traditionally, it is served with an unleavened corn-based flatbread known as Makki di Roti, though it can also be served with Paratha and steamed basmati rice.</p>
        <p>This sarson ka saag recipe is a labor of love, requiring both time and patience. Unfortunately, there is no shortcut method for making this dish; you’ll need to sort the greens, then wash, chop, and cook them before blending them, after which you’ll need to cook them again. It is a labor-intensive process, but none of the steps are difficult.</p>
        
        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul type= "square" >
            <li> 2 large dried red chile peppers (Optional) </li>
            <li> 2 bunches fresh spinach, washed and chopped </li>
            <li> 1 bunch mustard greens, washed and chopped </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) </li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon cumin seeds </li>
            <li> ¼ cup finely chopped onion </li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon ginger paste </li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons garlic paste </li>
            <li> ½ tomato, chopped </li>
            <li> salt to taste </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol type="I">
            <li>Place the chiles into a dry skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir until the chiles turn dark red-brown in color and give off their fragrance, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, allow to cool, and remove stems of chiles; shake out the seeds, and tear the flesh of the roasted chiles into pieces. Set aside. </li>
            <li>Place the spinach into a saucepan over medium heat; place mustard greens into a separate saucepan. If leaves are dry, mix in 1 or 2 of tablespoons of water. If leaves are still wet, just cover the pans and simmer the greens until tender, about 10 minutes. Allow to cool. </li>
            <li>Place greens together into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse several times to break up the greens, then process to a paste, about 1 minute. </li>
            <li>Heat ghee in a large saucepan over medium heat, and stir in the cumin seeds, stirring for about 30 seconds or until the seeds sizzle and turn a darker brown color. Mix in the onion, cook and stir until lightly browned, about 3 minutes, and mix in the roasted peppers, ginger paste, garlic paste, and tomato. </li>
            <li>Mix in the pureed greens, bring to a simmer, and stir in salt and sugar to taste. If dish is too thick, mix in up to about 1/4 cup of water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the greens are the desired thickness.
            </li>
        </ol>
