# odin_recipes
In this project odin_recipes, I'll be trying to make a beginner level website project showing some example recipes using my newly learnt html skills form TOD. 
It will need the knowledge of creating the basic html layout of a webpage, adding images, adding links, creating lists, formatting text using various tags used in html and linking locally saved webpages together.
